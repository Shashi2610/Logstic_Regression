# Logstic_Regression
# PROJECT TITLE:
To predict the heartattack diseases for organization (WHO:world Health Organization) using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or discreasing manner.
# Problem statement:
A WHO estimated 12 millions death records. One of them half off the death result is found in US. Theresearch scholars point out the relevant risk factor of heart attack as a DataScience engineer predict the overall risk using ML algorithm(Logistic Regression).
# Task:
1. Import the libraries required for prediction.

2. Import the Dataset using workspace.

3. Use the appropriate argument of sklearn Library to train, test and split the dataset

4. Fit your values with a range function using feature scalling

5. Check your model accuracy and precison using confusion matrix

# Conclusion:
According to the model analysis the Logistic Regression Algorithm works successfully with 0.6 accuracy.The accuracy shows that building model is successfull
